# SLU08: Functions intermediate

Now that you've got the basics regarding functions, let's take a look at a few ways in which they can be implemented and used. Since functions are all about allowing us to organize our code, knowing the different ways they can be used gives us a totally new set of superpowers.


### Positional and keyword arguments

Styling your arguments gives you more control over your inputs. You can:

- Help the user of your function by providing default values to arguments
- Make function calls easier to read


### Scopes and namespaces

Scopes and namespaces are all about understanding where variables live. In our case, it's about the behaviour of variables inside and outside of functions. It is absolutely fundamental to understand scopes as it will save you sooooooooo many debugging sessions in the future.


### Built-in functions

Python already has some integrated functions that, despite being non-editable, are available for us to use! We will go through some of the most used built-in functions.


### Fancy return statements

Your functions can have more than one output and you can choose different outputs based on some condition.

### Best practices

When writing a program or a script, how can you document all the functions and code so that they can easily be used and understood by any potential user? This is useful even for yourself, as programmers easily forget all the details of a function after some time has passed. 


## How to go through this SLU

1. Follow the [Weekly workflow](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2024/blob/main/weekly-workflow.md) to setup your environment.
2. Go through the Learning notebook.
3. Do the Exercise notebook, and submit it, as usual.

## "I need help understanding something"

You can and should ask for help, be it about Learning Notebooks, Exercises, or anything else. Please checkout the [Slack usage and how to ask for help](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2024/blob/main/slack.md), and remember not to share code when asking for help about the exercises!
