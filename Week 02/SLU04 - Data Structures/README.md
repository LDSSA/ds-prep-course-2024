# Small Learning Unit 04 - Data Structures

## What is in this SLU?

A Data Structure is a collection of data values that enables data organization, management, and storage. Different tasks and algorithms call for different data structures that could be more efficient for a specific application (e.g. faster access, easier manipulation). 

This learning unit covers theory and practical exercises regarding four types of data structures in Python: tuples, lists, dictionaries, and sets. It also provides information about data mutability in Python, and how data structures can be zipped/unzipped.

#### Main topics

- Tuple
- List
- Dictionary
- Set
- Intro to mutability
- zip function and the 'splat' operator
