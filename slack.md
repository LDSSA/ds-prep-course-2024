# Slack usage and how to ask for help

### New to Slack?

Slack is a messaging app for team communication. If you are new to Slack, check out this short [intro](https://slack.com/help/articles/360059928654-How-to-use-Slack--your-quick-start-guide). You can find more tutorials [here](https://slack.com/help/categories/360000049063).  
You can download the Slack app in the [Slack web page](https://slack.com/downloads/windows) or through [Micorsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9WZDNCRDK3WP&mode=mini).  
Although the app installation is recommended, if you don't wish to install Slack on your computer you can just use [Slack in the browser](https://app.slack.com/).

### How to use Slack nicely and effectively

Slack is our official communication channel. We will announce the release of the weekly learning materials and answer all your questions there. To make it a pleasant and productive experience for everyone, please follow these rules:

1. For your sanity, set how and when you want to be notified in `Preferences` -> `Notifications`.
1. You can install the Slack app on your phone.
1. Use the channel of the Week you're asking about for questions about the learning material.
1. Use the [#set-up](https://ldsaprepcourse2024.slack.com/archives/C06GMB5BHU7) channel for technical questions.
1. Check if your question was already asked before posting.
1. **Always answer in a thread**, it helps keep the conversations organized.
1. Use `Shift`+`Enter` for newlines, just `Enter` will send the message.
1. If you want to report bugs in the materials, you can open an [issue on the ds-prep-course-2024 repo](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2024/issues/).
1. If you want to give feedback post it in the [#feedback](https://ldsaprepcourse2024.slack.com/archives/C06H1T2AXFC) channel.
