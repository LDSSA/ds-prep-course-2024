    "- `+` - will match 1 or more repetitions of the symbol preceding it\n",
    "- `?` - will match 0 or 1 repetition of the symbol preceding it\n",
    "- `{m}` - will match *exactly* m repetitions of the symbol preceding it\n",
    "- `{m,n}` - will match m to n repetitions of the symbol preceding it\n",
