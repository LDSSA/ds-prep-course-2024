    "\n",
    "__Short answer:__ It doesn't. At least, not very well...\n",
    "\n",
    "__Long answer:__ PIP is the standard package manager that comes with Python. It allows you to install packages from PyPI and other indexes (repositories of Python packages). It also allows you to specify the version you *want* for the package. Notice that *want* might not be what you will *have*. \n",
    "\n",
    "PIP will go through your command or requirements file sequentially and install every package that you specified, with a *naive* approach to version management. By *naive* what we mean is that it will install exactly the version that you specified. However, if one of the following packages has a subdependency on a package already installed, __it will overwrite the former's version unless it also satisfies the latter's requirements__!\n",
    "\n",
    "Will overwrite:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "> depX == 1.0.0\n",
    "> depY == 2.0.0  # but depY v2.0.0 depends on having depX v1.5.0 installed -> will overwrite with depX == v1.5.0\n",
    "``` \n",
    "Will not overwrite:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "> depX == 1.0.0\n",
    "> depZ == 2.0.0  # depZ v2.0.0 depends on having depX >= v1.0.0 -> will leave v1.0.0 installed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if the overwritten version is __incompatible__ with the rest of our project or dependencies? \n",
    "\n",
    "__Answer:__ PIP does not care, PIP only installs. There is some leverage that package owners can enforce certain dependency versions, but you should be careful nonetheless. "

    "### 2.3. Beyond PIP\n",
    "\n",
    "In a professional environment you will most likely need to work with more powerful tools that are beyond the scope of this course. Tools like `poetry`, `pdm`, and `pipenv`, that will create virtual environments, *resolve* dependencies and lock exact versions. They will ensure that your dependencies play nice with each other. (*bonus remark*: these tools also make building packages and publishing them, much easier)\n",
    "\n",
    "And it won't stop there...if you delve into Python programming for long enough, you will start to see the necessity of having a tool such as `pyenv` that will help you manage Python version installations. Together with the aforementioned tools, your production-level projects might yet stand the test of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "And last but not least, as stated in a prior example there are tools that you can install in your system using PIP. Since these are typically not project-specific, but rather globally available in your system, you want a better way to install these that won't have potential clashes. That is why there are tools such as `pipx` that will handle the isolation of these types of packages behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are still early in your journey into Python programming and, as such, these are tools that you do not need right now. If you want to want to work in the industry, however, some of these are likely to show up.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Tip:__ Look into a couple of these tools before heading into technical interviews, as knowledge of their existence and necessity can help you stand-out. My suggestion would be either `poetry` or `pdm` for dependency resolution and virtual environment handling, and `pyenv` for managing different Python versions."
