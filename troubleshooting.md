### 1. When I open Windows Explorer through Ubuntu, it goes to a different folder than in the guide

Please make sure:

- you are running the command `explorer.exe .` including the dot at the end.
- you are running Windows 10 version `1909` or newer.

### 2. Ubuntu on Windows 10 high CPU usage, crashes

- Make sure you are running Windows 10 version `1909` or newer.
- Then, try following [these steps](https://teckangaroo.com/enable-windows-10-virtual-machine-platform/)

### 3. When I pull from the `ds-prep-course-2024` repository, I get an error

If you get an error like the following when pulling:

```
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
<some files>
Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge.
Aborting
```

what **'Git'** is telling you is that changes were made by you to the files in the `~/projects/ds-prep-course-2024` folder, and therefore it is not pulling the changes made by the instructors because they would overwrite the changes made by you.

To fix this do the following:

1. Make sure that any changes you made to the files in `~/projects/ds-prep-course-2024` (that you don't want to lose) are saved in your `~/projects/ds-prep-workspace` repository (refer to [Updates of the learning units](weekly-workflow.md#14-updates-of-the-learning-units) on how to do this). If you don't want to keep the changes you made to these files, just continue on to the next step.
2. Go to the `~/projects/ds-prep-course-2024` folder and run:

   ```bash
   cd ~/projects/ds-prep-course-2024
   git stash
   ```

3. Now you can pull from the `ds-prep-course-2024` repository:

   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

### 4. When I try to open the jupyter notebook, I get an error

Make sure that your virtual environment is activated **before** opening the jupyter notebook.

```bash
source ~/.virtualenvs/prep-venv/bin/activate
```

### 5. When I use the `cp` command the `>` sign appears and the command does not execute

```bash
cp -r ~/projects/ds-prep-course-2024/‚ÄúWeek 00" ds-prep-workspace
>
```

Make sure to use this type of quotes `"` and not these ones `‚Äú`.

### 6. When setting up python 3.11 I get an error

When I run this command:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
```

I get this error:

```bash
W: GPG error: http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt focal-pgdg InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 7FCC7D46ACCC4CF8
```

Solution: Take the id in front of `NO_PUBKEY` (in my case it's `7FCC7D46ACCC4CF8`) and run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 7FCC7D46ACCC4CF8
```

### 7. Nothing happens when I type my password in the terminal

When you type your password in the terminal, it is not visible. This is normal, just type the password and hit <kbd>enter</kbd>.

### 8. I still have a NotImplemented error

I've completed the exercise in the Exercise Notebook but when I run the cell I get a **NotImplementedError**.

Solution:
The `raise NotImplementedError()` is added to the exercise cell as a placeholder for where you're supposed to add your solution/code. It is meant to be removed!
