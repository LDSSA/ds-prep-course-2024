# 3. Setup *Git* and *GitHub*

**'Git'** is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code. A **'repository'** is where code lives, and the code from the prep course will live at [`ds-prep-course-2024`](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2024) repository (basically where you are right now, reading this). All the learning materials and exercises will be released (made available) on this repository. You will learn more about **'Git'** in the learning units 3 and 6.

### 3.1 Sign up for GitHub

**Step 1:** [Sign up](https://github.com/join) for a **'GitHub'** account and follow the instructions.

> üìù **'GitHub'** is a web-based platform used for version control and collaboration on software development projects providing tools for hosting and managing **'Git'** repositories.

**Step 2:** Open a **'terminal'**. Configure your email and username by running the 3 commands below. (**replace** `mig.dias.1212@gmail.com` below with the same email you used for github and `buedaswag` with your **'GitHub'** username).

```bash
git config --global user.email "mig.dias.1212@gmail.com"
git config --global user.username "buedaswag"
git config --global user.name "Bueda Swag"
```

### 3.2 Setup your workspace repository

The **'workspace directory/repository'** is where you will place everything you are working on, solve exercises, make changes to files, etc.

**Step 1:** Log into **'GitHub'**.

**Step 2:** In the upper-right corner of the page, click the "+" button and select **'New repository'**:

**Step 3:** Create a new **private** repository called `ds-prep-workspace`.

1. You need to explicitly select `Private` - this is your private work environment where nobody else will have access but you.

1. Initialize with a `README`.

1. Add a Python `.gitignore`. This file does exactly what it sounds like - it tells **'Git'** which files to ignore when transfering files between your computer and **'GitHub'**.

You can also check [Creating a new repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-new-repository) on GitHub for help.

### 3.3 Clone your workspace repository

Your **'workspace repository'** now exists on **'GitHub'**, but you also need a local copy (clone) on your computer. You will be working in the **'local workspace repository'** and then transfer your work to your **'remote workspace repository'** on **'GitHub'**.

**Step 1:** Open a terminal (or use one you've already opened).

**Step 2:** Create a folder named `projects` by using the `mkdir` command. Don't feel intimidated by these commands. They are simply `bash` - a language to communicate with your operating system. `mkdir` essentially stands for **m**a**k**e **dir**ectory. The tilde symbol `~` is a shortcut address for your home directory.

```bash
mkdir ~/projects
```

**Step 3:** Enter the folder by using the `cd` command. Did you know that `cd` means **c**hange **d**irectory? So basically changing to a different folder.

```bash
cd ~/projects
```

**Step 4:** You can now **clone** (create a local copy of) the `ds-prep-workspace` repository you created on **'GitHub'**.
Replace `<username>` below with your **'GitHub'** username, removing the brackets `< >`, and run the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/ds-prep-workspace.git
```

> üìù **Note**: if you have had a **'GitHub'** account since before this course and you are using **'SSH keys'** instead of **'tokens'**, first make sure that you have completed the steps starting [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys), then clone your repository like this. You can skip step 5 and continue with [section 3.4](#34-clone-the-ds-prep-course-2024-repository).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<username>/ds-prep-workspace.git
```

**Step 5:** You'll be asked for your **'GitHub'** username. Type it and press <kbd>enter</kbd>. Then you'll be asked for your git password. Passwords no longer work for **'GitHub'**, you will need to use **'tokens'**.

Go to <https://github.com/settings/tokens> and click on **'Generate new token'**. You can give it a name in the note field, such as `ldsa-token`. Then select `repo` in the scopes and click on **'Generate token'**. You will be shown a **'token'** you should save - ‚ö†Ô∏è **you will not be able to see it again after leaving that window**.

Now use the **'token'** instead of your password and press <kbd>enter</kbd>

You should now have a local copy of your `ds-prep-workspace` in your `~/projects/ds-prep-workspace` folder.

If the cloning worked out, you should see the cloned repository folder `ds-prep-course-2024` in your `projects` directory. You can see if it's there by listing its contents:

```bash
ls ~/projects
```

### 3.4 Clone the `ds-prep-course-2024` repository

Let's clone the [`ds-prep-course-2024`](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2024) repository. This is where all of the learning materials will be made available as the prep course progresses. You will be getting them (pulling) from there.

**Step 1:** Open a **'terminal'** (or use one you've already opened) and enter the `projects` folder:

```bash
cd ~/projects
```

**Step 2:** Clone the Prep Course repository (it's the same that contains the README you're reading right now!):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2024.git
```

If you are using **'SSH keys'** for **'GitHub'**, use this command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2024.git
```

If the cloning worked out, you should see the cloned repository folder `ds-prep-course-2024` in your `projects` directory. You can see if it's there by listing its contents:

```bash
ls ~/projects
```

**Step 3:** Copy the `requirements.txt` file from the **'prep course repository'** to your **'local workspace repository'**. The `cp` bash command means **c**o**p**y. Then you have the address of the file that is being copied and to where it is copied.

```bash
cp ~/projects/ds-prep-course-2024/requirements.txt ~/projects/ds-prep-workspace
```
You can check if the copying worked out by listing the contents of the `ds-prep-workspace` directory. The `requirements.txt` file should be there.

```bash
ls ~/projects/ds-prep-workspace
```

And you're done with setting **'Git'** and **'GitHub'**! Go back to the main menu and continue with [step 4](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2024/tree/main), setting up the virtual environment.
