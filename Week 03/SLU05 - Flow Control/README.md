# Small Learning Unit 05 - Flow Control

In this Learning Unit, you'll learn how to control the execution of your code and harness the power of programming!

<img src="./media/unlimited_power.gif" />

We'll start by reviewing and expanding our knowledge of booleans (Learning notebook 1). These will be used to control which part of the code is executed.

We'll then be (healthily) lazy and tell Python to repeat code without writing the same statement over and over again  (Learning notebook 2).

There is also an optional Learning notebook 3 where you can learn a few more tricks. It is not strictly necessary to study this notebook to complete the exercises.

This chapter is a big step forward in your programming journey and it might take a bit more effort than the previous chapters, therefore it has three exercise notebooks at increasing difficulty level - 0, 1, and 2. 

If you are a complete beginner, start with Exercise notebook 0, then continue to Exercise notebook 1. You can skip Exercise notebook 2 for now and come back to it later when you feel more comfortable with coding.

If you already have some programming experience, you can skip Exercise notebook 0. Start with Exercise notebook 1, then continue to Exercise notebook 2.

If you want to apply for the Lisbon Data Science Starters Academy this year, we recommend doing Exercise notebook 2 at some point.
