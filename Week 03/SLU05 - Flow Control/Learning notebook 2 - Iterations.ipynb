    "In this notebook, we will learn how to make Python repeat some code several times. There are two situations when we want to repeat the code. In the first situation, we know exactly how many repetitions are necessary. This is like going up a staircase to your apartment. You know that you have to climb 5 floors, so you repeat the action of climbing a floor 5 times and you are home. In the second situation, we don't know how many repetitions to make, but we know that we'll stop once a certain condition is fulfilled. This is like climbing a mountain. You don't know how many steps you'll have to take to get to the summit, but you know that you'll have to take another step until you get there. "
