If you plan to take the admission exam this year, it's a good idea to measure the time you need to solve this notebook. You can see how far you get in 2 hours and also how much time you need to complete the notebook. At the same time, it's a good idea to not rush through the exercises and rather concentrate on working thoroughly.\n",
